## UX Development

### 1. Project Goals

  [Alexey Kuzmis Photography](https://alexeykuz-sys.github.io/MS1-AKPhotography/)
		
The website is built for the inspiring photographer. The website will help photographer to reach potential clients, interested in fashion or model/actors headshots photoshoot and to exhibit photographer’s work.

Website features a gallery, testimonials, about page, prices, a clear step-by-step booking process and a contact page. 
The primary goal of the website is to show photographer's work in order to help potential customers to associate their needs with photographer's style, to see the history of previous assignments, customer's satisfaction level and to make the first contact with the photographer and promote photographer’s work.

As most of the photographer’s clients are consumers, the site is build to create easy and effortless process of finding, associating with client’s needs and booking. It’s mainly B2C orientation, which focuses on impulse booking rather than long tedious process of discussions and enquiries.

The website has to provide attractive, clear and safe framework for clients that will translate to safe and enjoyable experience during the photoshoot.

### 2.5. Design Choices

When designing this website, I looked for the design inspiration from various photographers websites and UX reviews on youtube.

I have noticed that some photographers have accent on the photo galleries rather easy way to navigate and to reach information or booking pages. It can cause frustration and stop potential customer from contacting photographer and booking the photography session. I tried to achieve the balance satisfying artistic and B2C requirements.

**2.5.1 Fonts**

I have used Google Fonts to determine the best fonts suitable for each part of the website, I.e. Logo, Menu and Body information.

I opted to use Open Sans font for my website, which is one of the most popular fonts used by major internet companies.

[Best Google Fonts](https://nestify.io/blog/top-10-best-google-fonts/)

**2.5.2. Icons**

Icons used where provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), used in moderation and are self explanatory.

**2.5.3. Colours**

The colours were determined by the palette of [Cooler](https://coolors.co/) website:

-   For body text and some titles: #22181C;
-   For Logo and and navbar menu and prices: #B71419;
-   For body background: #FAF9F9.

**2.5.4. Wireframe**

I used Figma to build Mobile and Desktop design of the website.

**Responsiveness** 

I've used **Bootstrap** and Flexbox throughout the project to ensure **maximum** responsibility, which is tested with the above tools.

**First Time Visitor Goals Test**
    
- As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the photographer.
- Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and intuitive navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image to give users the first impression of photographer work.
- The user has two options, click the menu or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the photographer.
- As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate easy and logically throughout the site to find content.
- The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user by excessive amount of photos or text. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
- Fixed to the top navigation bar ensures that user can easily navigate to the required page at any moment.
- As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what previous clients think of photographer's work and see if he can be trusted. There are also links to the social media to see how active, serious and trustful is a photographer.
- Once the new visitor has read the About they will reach Services page, where they can choose the kind of photography services they need and either look through the images stored in cloud to ensure fast website performance or to book services.
- The user can also scroll to the bottom of the Contact Page where there are alternatively way to contact photographer either directly or via social media links.

**Returning Visitor Goals Test**
    
- As a Returning Client, I want to find the photographer's latest works, availability calendar and booking form.
- These are clearly shown in the service page with call for action button and announcement line.
- The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
- Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that you can contact photographer directly or via social media.
- The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the photographer's mobile and email.
- Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
